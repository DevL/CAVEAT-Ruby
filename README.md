# CAVEAT

## PAQ (Pre-emptively Answered Questions)

> What is CAVEAT?

CAVEAT is a virtual machine for running a yet unnamed bytecode. It's part of the ClusterFuck concept where the various instructions in fact can be distributed over multiple machines. Communication between CAVEAT machines is to be performed using a yet unnamed protocol. A CAVEAT instance using an instruction provided by another CAVEAT instance is referred to as 'CAVEAT emptor'. The instance providing the instruction is in turn referred to as 'CAVEAT venditor'.

Obviously, a CAVEAT instance can provide an instruction to itself, just like one technically can sell things to oneself given certain circumstances. In such a situation, sales tax might apply.

Completely Asinine Virtual Executing Assembly Thingy.

> Is it a backronym?

How did you guess?

> Are you serious?

Seldom, but it happens. I'm serious about hacking on this though, purely for recreational and educational purposes.

> Educational?

Yes, I actually believe that developers of today can learn something by being restricted by minimal capabilities. I hope to reach a point where I can put together a meetup where participants implement an instruction each, thus making a given example program to run. Slightly similar to a wolf pack programming session, except that you actually wouldn't be working on the same code base or necessarily using the same language for that matter. Anyway, that's the idea.
